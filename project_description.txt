Network Testing Infrastructure Project Description

This project provides a comprehensive infrastructure for creating and executing network tests, specifically designed for testing network devices (routers) through CLI interfaces. The infrastructure enables automated testing of network configurations, routing protocols, and device behaviors.

Key Components:

1. CLI Session Management (cli_session.py):
- Provides a base interface for managing CLI sessions with network devices
- Supports multiple vendor implementations through an abstract base class
- Handles connection lifecycle, command execution, and configuration management
- Features:
  * SSH-based device connections
  * Command execution with response handling
  * Configuration management (edit, commit, rollback)

2. Response Parsing (decipher_base.py):
- Implements a framework for parsing CLI command responses into structured data
- Uses the Decipher abstract base class to define parsing interfaces
- Enables conversion of raw CLI text output into structured Python objects
- Supports vendor-specific parsing implementations

3. Testing Capabilities:
- Automated device configuration verification
- Routing protocol validation
- Multi-device consistency checks
- Complex network topology testing


4. This infrastructure is particularly useful for:
- Network engineers and operators
- Network testing teams
- Network device vendors
- Service providers
- Network automation teams
