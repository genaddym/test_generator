- step 1: Retrieve the devices for role a and role z, provided by the user as --device_a and --device_z pytest parameters.

    pcr01.site10.cran1             bundle-178              L2     Up            1M6d18h45m57s        28        point-to-point  
    pcr02.site10.cran1             bundle-223              L2     Up            1M3w14h29m41s        23        point-to-point  
- step 3: open IXIA connection and start the traffic items.
   Traffic items should be provided as a list in config.yml file. 
   Start traffic, wait 10 seconds and validate no traffic loss.
- step 4: on device a, disable the bundle interface by edit_config "interfaces bundle-ID admin-state disabled"
- step 5: wait 1 minute and enable the bundle interface by edit_config "interfaces bundle-ID admin-state enabled"
- step 6: stop the traffic items and retrieve the IXIA statistics. Packet loss duration should be less than 50ms.
